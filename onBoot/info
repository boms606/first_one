if systemd is available

    put .service files in "/etc/systemd/system/"
    ->  /etc/systemd/system/script1.service
    put scripts in "/usr/bin/"
    ->  /usr/bin/script1
    make sure scripts have 755 permissions (rwxr-xr-x)
    ->  chmod 755 usr/bin/script1
    enable service 
    ->  systemctl enable script.service

rc.local seems obsolete :(
